### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Data Scientist with a background in operational research, systems-engineering and electronic engineering. 

Welcome to my github, which will contain a selection of my personal data science projects using Python.
My favourite libraries include:
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Sklearn and XGboost for machine learning
- Scipy for optimisation 
- Pulp for linear programming 
- Simpy for simulations

Thanks for looking.

## Simulation
Repository | Details | Applications
--- | --- | ---
[Simulation_Optimisation](https://github.com/pierswalker71/Simulation_Optimisation)  |This programme has been created to demonstrate the use of Machine Learning to optimise the output of a simulator. <br>Techniques employed:<br>1. Generation of complex multi-dimensional function.<br>2. Machine Learning regression using Sklearn; including train-test-split.<br>3. Use of ML Pipelines; including data-scaling and polynomial transformations. <br>4. Hyper-parameter optimisation using deterministic or stochastic grid-search. <br>5. Global optimisation using Scipy. <br>6. Data manipulation using Pandas and Numpy. | Optimising business process simulations
