### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Data Scientist with a background in operational research, electronic engineering and systems-engineering. 

Welcome to my github, which will contain a selection of my personal data science projects using Python.
My favourite libraries include:
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Sklearn and XGboost for machine learning
- Scipy for optimisation 
- Pulp for linear programming 
- Simpy for simulations

Thanks for looking.
